# Visual Occupancy Counter

## Task: 
People Counter using YOLOv8

## Instruction to run the code:
- Ensure **Python** is installed in your system, or else you can even use Google Colab. I used **Google Colab** with **T4 GPU**.
- Download the **YOLOv8 model** file *yolov8n.pt* and place it in the same directory as the script.
- Place the *video file* you want to process and count the people from in the same directory as the script and rename it to **user_activities.mp4**.
- Run the script using the following command in your terminal

'''bash

python people_counter.py

## Dependencies:
This script depends on the following Python packages and hence need to be installed:
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics

These can be installed using
- pip install opencv-python
- pip install ultralytics
